# Frontend webpages using React and published on a Google Cloud Run container.

This interactive page is where the student will interact with the story, the problem, and AI tutor.

These are the DEMO pages intended to be run on a hosting service that can accomodate dynamic webpages, specifically meaning webpages that have database dependencies or use certain React state management functions that require server side compute.  Also, the hosting service should provide a simple user login method.   As of 28 JAN, icw hackathon, we think GCP Cloud Run containers are the approach we will use.  This repo is being setup for continuous deployment to GCP Cloud Run.
